 CHI_warlordism_disruption_desc:0 "In the treacherous world of warlord politics where it was common for subordinate officers to betray their commanders in exchange for bribes known as \"silver bullets\" and for one warlord to betray his allies, the warlords placed great stress on personal loyalty. Promotion within the warlord armies had little to do with competence, and instead warlords attempted to create an interlocking network of familial, institutional, regional and master-pupil relationships together with membership in sworn brotherhoods and secret societies within the officer corps to create and strengthen loyalty. In such a system, loyalty counted far more than did military competence."
