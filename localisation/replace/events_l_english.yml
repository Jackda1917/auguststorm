 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the working people and the poors has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of small parties and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"

 news.37.t:0 "The Assassination of Leon Trotsky"
 news.37.d:0 "Leon Trotsky, once the main Bolshevik Revolution's leader with Lenin, died today in a Mexico City hospital. He was attacked in his home with an ice axe by a Spanish national believed to have been in the employ of the NKVD. After a failed long politic struggle started in 1923 with Joseph Stalin and his allies, for the reintroduction of democracy and free debate in the Communist Party and the Soviets, Trotsky spent the thirties in exile, living in Turkey, France and Norway before finally settling in Mexico. He remained a constant critic of the dictatorial bureaucracy led by Stalin, in the name of Communism. He denounced in the many books he wrote, like 'The betrayed Revolution', Stalin's Soviet Union as a 'degenerated workers state'."

 news.159.d_01:0 "[From.GetLeader] announced today that [From.GetName] has reached out to form a new alliance. [From.GetFactionName] have made public their intent to cooperate in the case of war.\n\nAlthough great coalitions can deter against aggression, we've seen the consequences they bring when conflict does arise. The intentions of the different parties joining in this new alliance is still debatable, but what purpose it may end up serving may be unknown even to its instigators."
 news.159.d_02:0 "It has been theorized that democracies do not go to war with each other, but this does not mean they are guaranteed to aid each other in wars. As political interests are diverse and the people want peace, entering a war often comes at a great cost for these nations.\n\nHowever, this has not stopped [From.GetName] from announcing today that they have formed a military alliance, the [From.GetFactionName], to join forces in protecting their people and their ideals."
 news.159.d_03:0 "Even [From.GetName], famed for its faith in the strength and superiority of its people and nation, is not beyond forming alliances with those they respect. [From.GetLeader] announced today that the final agreements had been made about the [From.GetFactionName], a military coalition which purportedly room only for honorable nations destined for greatness.\n\nWhether this greatness is intended to come from building the ideal society within the borders of the respective nations or by working together to expand beyond them, the world may not know until it is too late."
 news.159.d_04:0 "Despite the recent Soviet focus on communism in one country, the internationalist roots of the movement transcend borders. This solidarity with workers around the world was a key element in [From.GetLeader]'s speech today when the [From.GetFactionName] was announced.\n\nGoing beyond a political International, this is an alliance that binds the countries militarily, with both regimes promising to aid each other against outside threats. Whether it will act as a sword or a shield for the communist revolution remains to be seen."
 news.159.d_05:0 "Internationalism is the main condition for Communism. The Stalinism has been unmasked as a treason of Marx and Lenin's ideas. The first condition of Socialism is to help the workers of the main industrial countries to break their chains. Not in asking for more freedom to their masters, but to definitively seize power!"

 soviet.48.d:0 "Stalin knows that the demoralization, the starvation, the privations caused by the civil war and the defeat of the other international revolutions, helped him to seize power. A new bureaucracy gradually emerging from this chaos, was pleased to find him as a leader. Even if it was one of the lesser-known among the ‘Historical’ Bolshevik leaders, Stalin’s brutality and tricky mind were invaluable to transform the party and the soviets as instruments of domination in the hands of this new ‘caste’. The opportunistic theory of ‘socialism in one country’ was the ideological justification of this treason. Unfortunately for Stalin, the new Working Class emerged from the rapid industrialization, encouraged by the increased confidence of the western working class, echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist totalitarianism : advocating political revolution, arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy. A powerful and giant strike wave started to embroil the Soviet Union. Stalin’s days seems numbered.

Some of them believe that Stalin's rule has failed, others suspect they are simply waiting for the day when the NKVD will find or make an excuse to have them arrested.\n\nTogether, they have formed a faction powerful enough to challenge the current administration. Their stated goal is to overthrow Stalin's tyranny and transition from a totalitarian state, with a board of military officers overseeing the process.\n\nStalin's supporters in the military and the Party have rallied to retain the current regime, calling their opponents counterrevolutionary traitors.

It marked the end of the Vichy regime as a nominally independent state and the disbandment of its army (the severely limited Armistice Army), though it continued its existence as a puppet government in occupied France. One of the last actions of its armed forces before their dissolution was the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon to prevent it from falling into Axis hands."

 as_germany.5.d:0 "The Service du travail obligatoire (English: Compulsory Work Service; STO) was the forced enlistment and deportation of hundreds of thousands of French workers to Nazi Germany to work as forced labour for the German war effort during World War II. The STO was created under laws and regulations of Vichy France , but it was used by Nazi Germany to compensate for its loss of manpower as it enlisted more and more soldiers for the Eastern Front. The German government promised that for every three French workers sent it would release one French prisoner of war. Those requisitioned under the STO were accommodated in work camps on German soil. French forced laborers were the only nationality to have been required to serve by the laws of their own state rather than by German orders. This was an indirect consequence of the autonomy negotiated from the German administration by the Vichy government. A total of 600,000 to 650,000 French workers were sent to Germany between June 1942 and July 1944. France was the third largest forced labor provider, after the USSR and Poland, and was the country that provided the largest number of skilled workers. 250,000 POWs also had to work for the Reich from 1943 onwards, having been "transformed", voluntarily or involuntarily, into civilian workers."

Although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war, it has been often credited as the most effective, efficient and influential tank design of the Second World War. At its introduction, the T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries; its heavy sloped armour was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons. When first encountered in 1941, the German tank general von Kleist called it ‘the finest tank in the world’ and Heinz Guderian confirmed the T-34's 'vast superiority' over existing German armour of the period."

The Tiger I gave the Wehrmacht its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the KwK 36 88-mm gun -not to be confused with the 8.8 cm Flak 36-. While the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time, it was over-engineered, using expensive materials and labour-intensive production methods. The Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and breakdowns, and was limited in range by its high fuel consumption. It was expensive to maintain, but generally mechanically reliable. It was also difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilization when mud, ice and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk-pattern road wheels, often jamming them solid. This was a problem on the Eastern Front in the muddy rasputitsa season and during extreme periods of cold."

Contemporary English language reports sometimes refer to it as the Mark V. The Panther was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 and to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV. Nevertheless, it served alongside the latter and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war. It is considered one of the best tanks of World War II for its excellent firepower and protection. Its reliability was less impressive."
