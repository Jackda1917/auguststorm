PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ENTIRELY BEFORE PLAYING THIS MOD :

For our great pleasure it is now obvious that there will be a large number of mods for HOI IV. Some of you are already familiar with August Storm (HOI III), some other never heard of it. We think that this diversity of mods is a chance for the player’s community and we would like to thanks PI developers for making games that give to the modders so many possibilities. This diversity is the reason why we thing that it could be fair for our mod’s potential players to know what we are trying to do.
So, just to be sure this mod is made for you, here is our modding philosophy:

What AS4 does:

1. Maximize the historical plausibility while trying to improve the gameplay and difficulty (be warned that AS4 will be really tough in Veteran mode).

2. Completion - Adding in missing countries, technologies, extending the timeline

3. Realism-Balance - Altering variables (or create new ones, when necessary) to make for a more realistic game. Balance is always secondary to this. Added features or functions won’t be necessarily “visible” at first glance (AS3 had a lot of “hidden” features, mostly build around dynamic features like the Strategic Effects). They will be included in a whole coherent system, for a better game experience. We singled out script effects not massive cosmetic effects.

4. UI - Making the user interface better both from usability and aesthetic aspects.

What AS4 won’t be:

1. A Mod Compilation - we will not be prioritizing compatibility with other mods that in any way compromises the above goals. Other groups are free to make AS-compatible versions of their mods, but we will not be providing any support. Of course it is always nice to have sub-mods, but we can’t assume to adapt other modder’s work. Trying to make one coherent mod is enough work for us (balance is our main concern, we love having fun playing balanced Multiplayer games).

2. A Pile of Rubble – Even if it would be very popular and “catchy” for some players, we will not be adding in hundreds of custom units (SS, Guards, Black-shirts), or hundreds of events (“Mussolini lost its cat” ….). We will add flavor where necessary using other means that are not duplicative or overly complicated. To keep the same examples, historical plausibility commands that SS units should be given by events (or similar system) and not built from nothing. Soviet GUARDS should be promoted existing units, based upon military experience, and not produced as “new” units.

3. A Promise - we write AS for ourselves first, and you last. We make our work available, but we don't owe you anything, we are not Paradox Interactive employees, you won't pay us for this work and we don't make this for money nor for glory.
We won't be adding features we are not agree with, nor accept all of your desires just to be the most popular modders.
If a feature is late, it is late. We have lives, and AS is a hobby for us. If we have to prioritize other things, we will.

What we need:

No surprise there: the more players will play the mod the more feedback you make, the more we could improve and polish it. We are also opened to any suggestion as long as it stays in the bound of our global modding philosophy.
